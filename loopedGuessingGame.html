	<h1>Looped Guessing Game</h1>
	
	<p>This guessing game exercise makes the user guess a number between a given range (in this case, 1 - 50) and provides responses in the form of prompts for each guess.</p>
	<p>This is a modification of the Simple Guessing Game exercise from The Web Developer Bootcamp. It uses While loops rather than asking the user to refresh the page after guessing incorrectly.</p>
